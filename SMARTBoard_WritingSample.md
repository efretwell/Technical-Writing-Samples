# Introduction to SMART Board

SMART Board is a valuable tool to have in the classroom. Classroom tasks often include displaying and reviewing information on transparencies, displaying videos and images, and giving presentations. SMART Board has the capability to do all of these tasks, plus many more. It can be used in a variety of ways to enhance your teaching and, in turn, enhance your students’ learning. 

SMART Board is a combination of software, which is loaded onto your laptop, and hardware, which includes the SMART Board screen, projector, pens, and eraser. When you connect your laptop (with the SMART Board software installed) to the SMART Board projector, you have access to all that SMART Board has to offer.

Anything that is displayed on the laptop is displayed through the SMART Board projector, and onto the SMART Board screen. From the SMART Board screen, you are able to use your finger as a mouse to access things on your laptop. This allows you to be at the front of the classroom at all times. The ease and multiuse factor of SMART Board also removes the extra time spent creating display documents on multiple mediums and setting up various display machines. 

## What makes SMART Board different?

SMART Board can be used as a projector for presentations. The SMART Board projector will show anything that is displayed on the connected laptop. This means that you are able to access all computer files, documents, and the internet, all from the SMART Board screen. It also takes the place of an overhead projector. With SMART Board, you do not have to copy documents onto transparencies to show them to your class via the overhead projector. Access the document on your laptop directly from the SMART Board screen to display it to the classroom.

The SMART Board screen looks like a standard white board and you can write on it like you would a standard whiteboard (using SMART Board pens, which are explained in the Getting Started section). What makes SMART Board different is the touch capability of the screen, enabling it to be used as an interactive whiteboard. With SMART Board, you are able to display anything from your laptop, and write on the SMART Board screen. Any notes that are made on the SMART Board screen can be saved as a layer on the document. When the document is opened at a later date, the notes made on the SMART Board screen are shown as part of the document. This allows you to pick up right where you left off.

# Precautions

When using SMART Board, there are a few things that must be done so that everything works properly.

Always begin setting up SMART Board with your laptop turned off. If the laptop is on when SMART Board is connected, the configuration will not be accurate. Pressure applied to the SMART Board screen could activate incorrect programs on your computer or scramble desktop icons.

Do not use standard whiteboard markers or pens on the SMART Board screen – use only SMART Board pens. The SMART Board screen is touch sensitive and created specifically for use with SMART Board pens and your hands. Using anything else will damage the screen.

If you have problems with SMART Board, refer to the Troubleshooting section located in the Appendix of this manual.

# Set-up and Configuration of SMART Board 

The manual setup of SMART Board consists mainly of linking power cords, turning on the projector, and placing the SMART Board pen tools and eraser in their proper positions on the SMART Board pen tray. The configuration section will discuss orienting the “touch sensitive” screen to your personal finger pressure.
